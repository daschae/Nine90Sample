Nine90Sample
================================================================================

A sample project that demonstrates how to make use of the component(s) in the [Nine90] (https://github.com/daschae/Nine90) project. Reviewing the settings in this project should put you on the right track for making use of the library.

*NOTE* The simplest way to use [Nine90] (https://github.com/daschae/Nine90) is to add it to your current project's workspace.

Components
----------

The following components are currently available. I'll add more as time allows.

*   N90SelectControl (iPhone only)
    > A drop down control implemented via a slide up picker similar to 
    > MobileSafari's implementation of a select element on iOS. This component
    > currently only supports portrait orientation.
    
TODO
----

*   Enhance N90SelectControl to support landscape orientation.
*   Enhance N90SelectControl to support the iPad to match MobileSafari's 
    behavior there as well.
*   Develop additional components.
